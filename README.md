# Firuma: From Thoughts to Prompts

**Firuma** is a fun, experimental project that generates dynamic prompts based on user input in various tonesâ€”formal, poetic, funny, minimalist, and more. Currently in an early prototype stage, it explores natural language processing through interactive prompt generation, without yet integrating any large language models (LLMs). Itâ€™s built with Streamlit and designed for quick experimentation with tone-aware prompt construction. Future updates aim to incorporate LLMs and more advanced tone and context detection.

## Features

-  Interactive prompt generation based on user input  
-  Tone-aware suggestion system (funny, poetic, minimalist, etc.)  
-  Sentiment-driven tone adjustment via TextBlob  
-  Five prompt variants generated per input  
-  Feedback capture for quality improvement  
-  Sidebar with history of recent interactions  

---

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend/UI:** Streamlit  
- **NLP Tools:** TextBlob, NLTK  
- **Local LLM (future):** GPT4All  
- **Utilities/Data:** pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn

## Future Plans

-  Integrate GPT4All-based response generation (`gpt_runner.py`)  
-  Add image and code category detection from natural input  
-  Replace basic sentiment detection with transformer-based classifiers  
-  Track tone usage and feedback stats over time
